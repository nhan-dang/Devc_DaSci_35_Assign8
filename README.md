Since the data is large so i convert from csv to hdf and upload in my drive. Below is 2 links of data:
  + CSV: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S9nWS8ivuxe6NIuHpDLiVKa5uOTnZ03I
  + HDF: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wYCXZ11SFuxjV7ZnxnpB3PifIOLf_sHo

I use plotly so it should be better to download it and run or using tool online nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view it
